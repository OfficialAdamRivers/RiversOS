- **Lightweight Dependencies**: Uses pre-installed or easily configurable libraries
- **Offline Capability**: Functions with cached data when internet access is limited

### Execution Flow:
1. System initializes and creates necessary directories
2. Attempts data collection from external sources
3. Falls back to cached/sample data if scraping fails
4. Processes collected data through AI models
5. Generates all output formats (text, audio, video)
6. Launches interactive chatbot session

### Error Handling:
- Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable
- Fallback to sample data to maintain functionality
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

The system is designed to be resilient and functional even in constrained environments, making it ideal for deployment on platforms like Replit where resources and connectivity may be limited.
